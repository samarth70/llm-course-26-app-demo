## Problem

Traditional penetration testing is a highly manual, time-consuming, and expensive process. As digital infrastructures grow and cyber threats evolve rapidly, organizations struggle to maintain continuous security posture assessments. There is a critical need for an automated, intelligent system that can simulate attacker reconnaissance, identify vulnerabilities, and document findings without requiring constant human intervention.


## Solution

The AI Pentest Scanner is an autonomous security testing pipeline that uses a multi-agent LLM architecture to perform end-to-end security assessments. The system seamlessly chains together four distinct phases: Reconnaissance, Vulnerability Scanning, Exploitation Planning, and Report Generation. By leveraging the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), the application not only discovers security flaws but also intelligently contextualizes them, eliminating false positives and generating professional-grade security deliverables (Markdown, HTML, JSON, and PDF) automatically.

## User Flow

- **First step**: The user initiates a scan by providing a target domain or IP address via the web UI or the command-line interface. 
- **Second step**: The system asynchronously engages the Multi-Agent Protocol, running Reconnaissance (identifying subdomains, ports, and tech stacks) followed by Heuristic Vulnerability Scanning.
- **Third step**: The system evaluates findings to simulate exploit vectors (in a safe, dry-run capacity) and intelligently synthesizes all gathered data into a comprehensive report.
- **Fourth step**: The user reviews and downloads the final professional security assessment report directly from the interface.

## LLM Components

- **Recon Agent** - Orchestrates passive OSINT reconnaissance and analyzes target context to map the attack surface.
- **Vuln Scanner Agent** - Ingests reconnaissance data and uses heuristic analysis to intelligently identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
- **Exploit Engine Agent** - Evaluates the confirmed vulnerabilities to formulate and plan theoretical exploit vectors, emphasizing impact and severity.
- **Report Writer Agent** - Synthesizes vast amounts of data from the previous agents to author a cohesive, professional, and human-readable security assessment report.

## Tools

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide React (Deployed via Cloudflare Workers/Pages)
- **Backend:** Python, Flask, threading (Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces)
- **LLM:** Groq API (High-performance inference) and Google Gemini API
